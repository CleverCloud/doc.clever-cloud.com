## Configure your Scala application
### Mandatory configuration

Your application has to listen on port `8080` for worldwide connections (`0.0.0.0`). We set the system variable `http.port` to `8080` for you so in many cases (like for play applications) you don't have anything to do.
You need to use the [sbt-native-packager](#the-sbt-native-packager) in your project.

### The sbt-native-packager
We rely on `sbt-native-packager` to run applications. This plugin provides a `stage` task which is run during deployment.

If your project doesn't already use [sbt-native-packager](https://GitHub.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager), you need to add it to `project/plugins.sbt`. Please make sure you use an up-to-date version.

In `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-native-packager" % "1.7.0")
```

Then you need to configure the package type:

In `build.sbt`:

```scala
enablePlugins(JavaAppPackaging)

# Disable javadoc packaging
mappings in (Compile, packageDoc) := Seq()
```

For more information, please have a look at the [documentation for sbt-native-packager](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/index.html)

#### Custom sbt goal

By default, the deployment system execute `sbt stage` and runs the first binary found into `/target/universal/stage/bin`. If you want to run another goal, you can specify it with the `SBT_DEPLOY_GOAL` [environment variable](#setting-up-environment-variables-on-clever-cloud).

#### Multi-module build

If you have a single repository with multiple modules or want to build a specific module in a monorepo (and no top-level `stage` task), then you can specify the sbt task with `SBT_DEPLOY_GOAL`.

`CC_SBT_TARGET_DIR` must be set to the relative path of the module and `CC_SBT_TARGET_BIN` to the name of the binary to run.

For instance, if you want to deploy a module named `service1` that produce a binary named "my-binary", you have to define the following variables:
```
SBT_DEPLOY_GOAL=service1/stage
CC_SBT_TARGET_DIR=service1
CC_SBT_TARGET_BIN=my-binary
```
Check details on [environment variables](#setting-up-environment-variables-on-clever-cloud).

Our engine will execute the `sbt service1/stage` and will run `service1/target/universal/stage/bin/my-binary`

**Note:** even when `CC_RUN_COMMAND` is configured `CC_SBT_TARGET_DIR` and `CC_SBT_TARGET_BIN` should be set to the correct values.

### HOCON users

If you're using
[HOCON](https://GitHub.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#hocon-human-optimized-config-object-notation) configuration files, then you can have direct acces to environment variables from the configuration file:

```
application.secret=${APPLICATION_SECRET}
```
