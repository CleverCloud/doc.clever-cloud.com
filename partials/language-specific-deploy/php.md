## Configure your PHP application

### Choose your PHP version

Set the `CC_PHP_VERSION` environment variable to one of the following values:

- `5.6`
- `7.2`
- `7.3`
- `7.4`
- `8.0`
- `8.1`

All new PHP applications are created with a default `CC_PHP_VERSION`, set to 7, which means latest php 7 version available.

You can of course change it whenever you want then redeploy your application to use the version you want. We only support values based on the first two digits `X.Y` not `X.Y.Z`.

The configuration file for your PHP application must be `/clevercloud/php.json`, that is a *php.json* file in a `/clevercloud` folder at the root of your application.

### Change the webroot

Since one of the best practices of PHP development is to take the libraries and core files outside the webroot, you may
want to set another webroot than the default one (*the root of your application*).

#### Using an environment variable

Add a new environment variable called `CC_WEBROOT` and set `/public` as its value. 

```
clever env set CC_WEBROOT /public
```

#### Using a configuration file

To change the webroot, just set the key `webroot` in the `deploy` part
of the configuration file *clevercloud/php.json* with the absolute path (*from the root of your application*) of your new public folder.

In the following example we want to set the webroot to the folder `/public`:

```json
{
    "deploy": {
        "webroot": "/public"
    }
}
```

{{< alert "warning" "Warning:" >}}
    Please note the absolute path style: `/public`. The change of the webroot will be rejected during the deployment if the target directory does not exist or is not a directory.
{{< /alert >}}

### Change PHP settings


#### PHP settings

Most PHP settings can be changed using a `.user.ini` file.

If you want the settings to be applied to the whole application, you should put this file in your `webroot`. If you did not change it (see above), then your `webroot` is the root of the repository.

If you put the `.user.ini` file in a sub-directory; settings will be applied recursively starting from this sub-directory.

##### Timezone configuration

All instances on Clever Cloud run on the UTC timezone. We recommend to handle all your dates in UTC internally, and only handle timezones when reading or displaying dates.

Additionally, you can set PHP's time zone setting with `.user.ini`. For instance, to use the french time zone, edit `.user.ini` to add this line:

```ini
date.timezone=Europe/Paris
```

##### Header injection

Usually, you can use an `.htaccess` file to create / update / delete headers.
You won't be able to do it from the `.htaccess` file if the headers come from a `.php` file, because `php-fpm` ignores the `mod_headers` plugin.
It works fine for static files directly served by apache.

So if you need to inject headers on HTTP responses (for instance for [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)),
you have to do it from PHP (you can't do it from `.htaccess`).

```php
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
```

If you want to keep this separate from your application, you can configure the application to execute some code on every request.

In `.user.ini`, add the following line (you need to create `inject_headers.php` first):

```ini
auto_prepend_file=./inject_headers.php
```

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php) for more information. You can review the [available directives](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php); all the `PHP_INI_USER`,
`PHP_INI_PERDIR`, and `PHP_INI_ALL` directives can be set from within
`.user.ini`.

**Note**: `.user.ini` files are not loaded by the php cli

#### `clevercloud/php.json` settings

Other settings than the one mentioned above can be changed by adding the following line in `clevercloud/php.json`:

```json
{
    "configuration": {
        "my.setting": "value"
    }
}
```

Here is the list of available settings:

* `mbstring.func_overload`
* `pm.max_children`

**Note**: You can send a request to the support if you need to change a setting which cannot be changed via a `.user.ini` file and is not in this list.

##### Memory Limit

When php-fpm spawns a worker it allocates a smaller part of the application's memory to the worker, here is the allocated memory for each flavor:

{{<table "table table- bordered" "text-align:center" >}}
 | <center>Flavor</center> | <center>Memory Limit</center> |
 |-----------------------|------------------------------|
 |Pico | 64M |
 |Nano | 64M |
 |XS | 128M |
 |S | 256M |
 |M | 384M |
 |L | 512M |
 |XL | 768M |
 |2XL | 1024M |
 |3XL | 1536M |
 |4XL+ | 2048M |
 {{< /table >}}

To change this limit you can define `MEMORY_LIMIT` [environment variable]({{< ref "reference/reference-environment-variables.md#php" >}}).

If you define a limit exceeding the application memory it will use the default one.

##### `pm.max_children`: Maximum PHP Children per instance

You can fix the maximum number of PHP running processes per instance by setting `pm.max_children` (see above).

This setting is useful if you need to limit the number of running processes according to the maximum connections limit of your MySQL or PostgreSQL database.

By default, `pm.max_children` is set to **10**.

## Configure Apache

We use Apache 2 as HTTP Server. In order to configure it, you can create a `.htaccess` file and set directives inside this file.

### htaccess

The `.htaccess` file can be created everywhere in you app, depending of the part of the application covered by directives.
However, directives who applies to the entire application must be declared in a `.htaccess` file to the application root.

### htpasswd

If you need basic authentication, you can use the `.htpasswd` file. The path to the `.htpasswd` of the `AuthUserFile` directive has to be absolute. Your site root folder is available at `/var/www/bas/site/`, so the directive should look like:
`AuthUserFile /var/www/bas/site/.htpasswd`

Alternatively, you can configure basic authentication using [environment variables]({{< ref "reference/reference-environment-variables.md#php" >}}). You will need to set `CC_HTTP_BASIC_AUTH` variable to your own `login:password` pair. If you need to allow access to multiple users, you can create additional environment `CC_HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_n` (where `n` is a number) variables.

### Define a custom HTTP timeout

You can define the timeout of an HTTP request in Apache using the `HTTP_TIMEOUT`
[environment variable]({{< ref "develop/env-variables.md" >}}).

**By default, the HTTP timeout is se to 3 minutes (180 seconds)**.

### Force HTTPS traffic

Load balancers handle HTTPS traffic ahead of your application. You can use the
`X-Forwarded-Proto` header to know the original protocol (`http` or `https`).

Place the following snippet in a `.htaccess` file to ensure that your visitors
only access your application through HTTPS.

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

### Prevent Apache to redirect HTTPS calls to HTTP when adding a trailing slash

`DirectorySlash` is enabled by default on the PHP scalers, therefore Apache will add a trailing slash to a resource when it detects that it is a directory.

eg. if foobar is a directory, Apache will automatically redirect http://example.com/foobar to http://example.com/foobar/

Unfortunately the module is unable to detect if the request comes from a secure connection or not. As a result it will force an HTTPS call to be redirected to HTTP.

In order to prevent this behavior, you can add the following statements in a `.htaccess` file:

```apache
DirectorySlash Off
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^(.+[^/])$ %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto}://%{HTTP_HOST}/$1/ [R=301,L,QSA]
```

These statements will keep the former protocol of the request when issuying the redirect. Assuming that the header X-Forwarded-Proto is always filled (which is the case on our platform).

If you want to force all redirects to HTTPS, you can replace `%{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto}` with `https`.

### Change the FastCGI module

You can choose between two FastCGI modules, `fastcgi` and `proxy_fcgi`.

To choose between these two modules you must use the `CC_CGI_IMPLEMENTATION` environment variable with `fastcgi` or `proxy_fcgi` as a value.

{{< alert "info" "Recommandation" >}}
We recommend preferring `proxy_fcgi` over `fastcgi`. The `fastcgi` implementation is not maintained anymore, but has been kept as default to prevent unexpected behaviors with historical applications.
{{< /alert >}}

If you have issues with downloading content, it could be related to the `fastcgi` module not working correctly in combination with the `deflate` module, as the `Content-Length` header is not updated to the new size of the encoded content.

To resolve this issue, we advise you to switch the value of `CC_CGI_IMPLEMENTATION` from default to `proxy_fcgi`.

### Environment injection

As mentionned above, Clever Cloud can inject environment variables that are defined in the
dashboard and by add-ons linked to your application.

To access the variables, use the `getenv` function. So, for example, if
your application has a postgresql add-on linked:

```php
<?php

$dbh = new PDO(
  'postgresql:host='.getenv("POSTGRESQL_ADDON_HOST").';dbname='.getenv("POSTGRESQL_ADDON_DB"),
  getenv("POSTGRESQL_ADDON_USER"),
  getenv("POSTGRESQL_ADDON_PASSWORD")
);
```

{{< alert "warning" "Warning:" >}}
    <p>Environment variables are displayed in the default output of `phpinfo()`.
    If you want to use `phpinfo()` without exposing environment variables, you have to call it this way:
    </p>
    ```php
    phpinfo(INFO_GENERAL | INFO_CREDITS | INFO_CONFIGURATION | INFO_MODULES | INFO_LICENSE)
    ```
{{< /alert >}}

## Composer

We support Composer build out of the box. You just need to provide a `composer.json` file in the root of your repository and we will run `composer.phar install --no-ansi --no-progress --no-interaction --no-dev` for you.

You can also set the `CC_COMPOSER_VERSION` to `1` or `2` to select the composer version to use.

{{< alert "info" "Note:" >}}
    If you encounter any issues, add your own `composer.phar` file in the root of your repository which will override the version we use.
{{< /alert >}}

You can perform your own `composer.phar install` by using the [Post Build hook]({{< ref "develop/build-hooks.md#post-build-cc_post_build_hook" >}}).

Example of a `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "laravel/framework": "4.1.*",
        "ruflin/Elastica": "dev-master",
        "shift31/laravel-elasticsearch": "dev-master",
        "natxet/CssMin": "dev-master"
    },
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://GitHub.com/timothylhuillier/laravel-elasticsearch.git"
        }
    ],
    "autoload": {
        "classmap": [
            "app/controllers",
            "app/models",
            "app/database/migrations",
            "app/database/seeds"
        ],
        "psr-0": {
            "SomeApp": "app"
        }
    },
    "config": {
        "preferred-install": "dist"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev"
}
```

Example of a minimalist PHP application using composer and custom scripts: [php-composer-demo](https://GitHub.com/CleverCloud/php-composer-demo)

## Development Dependencies

Development dependencies will not be automatically installed during the deployment. You can control their installation by using the `CC_PHP_DEV_DEPENDENCIES` environment variable which takes `install` value.

Any other value than `install` will prevent developement dependencies from being installed.

### GitHub rate limit

Sometimes, you can encounter the following error when downloading dependencies:

```txt
Failed to download symfony/symfony from dist: Could not authenticate against GitHub.com
```

To prevent this download dependencies's fails that is often caused by rate limit of GitHub API while deploying your apps,
we recommend you to add `oauth` token in your composer configuration file or in separate file named as described in
[composer FAQ (API rate limit and OAuth tokens)](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#api-rate-limit-and-oauth-tokens).

You can find more documentation about composer configuration at [getcomposer.com](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md).

#### Example

You use Artisan to manage your project and you want to execute _artisan migrate_ before running your app.

To do this, we use a post build hook, you have to set a new environment variable on your Clever application as following:
 
```bash
CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK=php artisan migrate --force
```

<strong>Note: </strong>You must add the _execute_ permission to your file (`chmod u+x yourfile`) before pushing it.

## Frameworks and CMS

The following is the list of tested CMS by our team.

It's quite not exhaustive, so it does not mean that other CMS can't work on the Clever Cloud platform.

<div class="">

## Use Redis to store PHP Sessions

By default, sessions are stored on a replicated file system, so that session data is available on each instance. We also provide the possibility to store the PHP sessions in a [Redis database]({{< ref "deploy/addon/redis.md" >}}) to improve performance: if your application is under heavy load, redis persistence for sessions can improve latency.

To enable this feature, you need to:

 - enable Redis support on the application (create an [environment variable]({{< ref "develop/env-variables.md" >}}) named `ENABLE_REDIS` with the value `true`.)
 - create and link a Redis add-on
 - create an [environment variable](#setting-up-environment-variables-on-clever-cloud) named `SESSION_TYPE` with the value `redis`.

{{< alert "warning" "Warning:" >}}
    You must have a [Redis]({{< ref "deploy/addon/redis.md" >}}) add-on [linked with your application](#linking-a-database-or-any-other-add-on-to-your-application) to enable PHP session storage in Redis.

    If no Redis add-on is linked with your application, the deployment will fail.
{{< /alert >}}

## Sending emails

The PHP language has the `mail` function to directly send emails. While we do not provide a SMTP server (needed to send the emails), you can configure one through environment variables.

We provide Mailpace addon to send emails through PHP `mail()` function. You have to turn TLS on with port 465 (environment variable `CC_MTA_SERVER_USE_TLS=true`) to make Mailpace working.

We also recommend you to use [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) or [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) if your project supports it. These services already have everything you need to send emails from your code.

### Configure the SMTP server

Services like [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) or [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) provide SMTP servers. If your application has no other way but to use the `mail` function of PHP to send emails, you have to configure a SMTP server. This can be done through environment variables:

- `CC_MTA_SERVER_HOST`: Host of the SMTP server.
- `CC_MTA_SERVER_PORT`: Port of the SMTP server. Defaults to `465` whether TLS is enabled or not.
- `CC_MTA_AUTH_USER`: User to authenticate to the SMTP server.
- `CC_MTA_AUTH_PASSWORD`: Password to authenticate to the SMTP server.
- `CC_MTA_SERVER_USE_TLS`: Enable or disable TLS. Defaults to `true`.
- `CC_MTA_SERVER_STARTTLS`: Enable or disable STARTTLS. Defaults to `false`.
- `CC_MTA_SERVER_AUTH_METHOD`: Enable or disable authentication. Defaults to `on`.

## Configure Monolog

A lot of frameworks (including Symfony) use Monolog to handle logging. The default configuration of Monolog doesn't allow to log errors into the console.
Here is a basic configuration of Monolog to send your application's logs into our logging system and access them into the Console:

```yaml
monolog:
  handlers:
    clever_logs:
      type:     error_log
      level:    warning
```

You can change the level to whatever level you desire. For Symfony, the configuration file is `app/config/config_prod.yml`.

Laravel doesn't need Monolog to retrieve logs via Clever console or Clever CLI. Here, ensure that you have the following line in `config/app.php`:

```php
...
'log' => env('APP_LOG'),
...
```

Then, set `APP_LOG=syslog` as Clever application environment variable.


## Using HTTP authentication

Using basic HTTP authentication, PHP usually handles the values of user and password in variables named `$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER']` and `$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW']`.

At Clever Cloud, we have enabled an Apache option to pass directly the Authorization header, even though we are using FastCGI; still, the header is not used by PHP, and the aforementioned variables are empty.

You can do this to fill them using the Authorization header:

```php
list($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'], $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW']) = explode(':' , base64_decode(substr($_SERVER['Authorization'], 6)));
```
