## Configure your Haskell application

### Mandatory configuration

Be sure that:

* you have pushed in **master branch**
* you listen on **port 8080**
* you have one and only one binary target in your [`.cabal` file](#dependencies)
* your project has a `stack.yaml` file

The steps ran in order are:

 - `stack setup`
 - `stack install --only-dependencies`
 - `stack install`
 - `./<path>/my-exe` (or the contents of `CC_RUN_COMMAND`)

The executable built by `stack build` (or the command you specify) must start a web server listening on `0.0.0.0:8080`.

For instance, a minimal [scotty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty) application can look like this:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Web.Scotty

main = scotty 8080 $ do
  get "/" $ do
    html $ "Hello world"
```

### Dependencies

Make sure to list all your dependencies in your `.cabal` file.

For the example above, you need:

```cabal
executable myfirstapp
    main-is: Main.hs
    build-depends: base
                 , scotty
```

### Cached dependencies

You can enable dependencies caching by adding the `CC_CACHE_DEPENDENCIES=true`.

It is enabled by default only for rust and haskell applications.

To disable dependencies caching completely, you can remove the `CC_CACHE_DEPENDENCIES` environment variable or by setting it to `false`.

To fully remove cached dependencies, you have to rebuild your application from scratch.

You can select **rebuild and restart** from the console or launch `clever restart --without-cache` with the Clever Tools CLI.

### Custom run command

If you need to run a custom command (or just pass options to the binary built by stack), you can specify it through the `CC_RUN_COMMAND` environment variable.

For instance, for a [hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) website, you can define:

```bash
CC_RUN_COMMAND="~./local/bin/site server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080"
```

To access environment variables from your code, just get them from the environment with `getEnv :: String -> IO String` in `System.Environment`.

If some environment variables are critical to your application, here is an approach you can use:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
module Main where

import Data.Text.Lazy (pack)
import System.Environment (getEnv)
import Web.Scotty (get, html, scotty)

envVar = getEnv "MY_VAR"

main = do
  myVar <- envVar
  scotty 8080 $ do
    get "/" $ do
      html . pack $ "Hello world " ++ myVar
```
This loads the environment variable in your `main` function and tests it. This way, the application will refuse to start with an helpful error message if `MY_VAR` is not defined.

### Specify Stack package target

You may have several packages in your application which can be time consuming when building them, if you don't want to build every packages you can target a package by using the `CC_HASKELL_STACK_TARGET` [environnement variable](#setting-up-environment-variables-on-clever-cloud).

```bash
CC_HASKELL_STACK_TARGET="mypackage"
```
