## Environment injection

Clever Cloud injects environment variables from your application settings as mentioned in [setting up environment variables](#setting-up-environment-variables-on-clever-cloud) and is also injecting in your application production environment, those from your [linked add-ons](#linking-a-database-or-any-other-add-on-to-your-application).
