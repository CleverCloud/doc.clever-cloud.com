## Create a Clever Cloud account

The API of Clever Cloud uses OAuth 1 to perform authentication actions.
There are two ways to signup to Clever Cloud: **email** or **GitHub login**.

Go to the [Clever Cloud Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com/) and select the method you prefer.

### Email Authentication

This kind of auth requires a valid and non-temporary disposable e-mail, and a password having at least 6 characters.
Do not forget to validate your email by clicking the link you will receive.

### GitHub Authentication

The GitHub signup allows you to create an account or link your existing one to GitHub, in one click.
This process asks the following permissions:Â 

* Read your Public Key
* Read User Repositories

The "repository permission" is used to deploy your GitHub apps directly to Clever Cloud, with a simple step.

If you need to give access to Clever Cloud's API to a specific GitHub organization, you
can [do it here](https://GitHub.com/settings/connections/applications/d96bd8fd996d2ca783cc).

### Two Factor Authentication (2FA)

Clever Cloud supports 2FA. You can enable it here: https://console.clever-cloud.com/users/me/authentication

Please, backup your recovery codes, we won't be able to restore access to your account if you lose access to your regular codes.
