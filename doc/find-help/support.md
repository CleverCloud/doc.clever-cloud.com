We provide basic support free-of-charge to all our users, even those who are not paying customers.

## Email

Seek help by querying us by email, allowing you to quickly gain answers to your Clever Cloud specific questions and open a ticket directly with our support staff. We will respond to your email within a few hours, or two business days in the worst case.

## Ticket Center

You can find in the console a button to start a conversation with our engineers. For each new ticket it will create a new thread, on a specific subject. Therefore, you can create several tickets for each issue.  

If you open a ticket inside an organisation with members, they will be added to the discussion by e-mail.

Feel free to use it when this service available, from 9 a.m to 6 p.m <acronym title="Central European Summer Time">CEST</acronym>+2 during open business days.
