PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility
and on standards-compliance.

## Versions

The version currently installed by the add-on is :

- on shared plans (DEV) : PostgreSQL 15
- on newly created dedicated databases (plans XS Small Space and above) : PostgreSQL 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

## Migrating from an old database

Some applications require a populated database to run properly.
If you want to import your **SQL** dump, you can use several methods:

1. [Our WebGUI (Adminer)](https://dbms-adminer.clever-cloud.com/).
2. Command line tool for PostgreSQL administration like `psql`.
3. Any PostgreSQL client such as [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).


## Direct access

All our dedicated PostgreSQL databases are served via a proxy. To reduce the latency you can bypass this proxy by generating direct hostname and port for the addon. You can do it by clicking the "Generate direct hostname and port" on the addon dashboard.

This action will add new environment variables to reach the addon without any proxy.

Keep in mind that usage of direct access is a trade-off: when you migrate your addon, you will need to to generate hostname and port again so your application must update these environment while proxy usage changes nothing.

## Encryption at rest

Encryption at rest is available on PostgreSQL. You can have more information on the [dedicated page]({{< ref "doc/administrate/encryption-at-rest.md" >}})

## Note on shared databases

Free databases are instantiated from a shared cluster. The way postgresql works on shared clusters is that a "pg_database" table references the name, and only the name, of other databases in that same cluster. The data, on the other hand, is not accessible.

This referencing does not exist for dedicated databases.

## Automatic vacuuming

[Autovacuum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html) is automatically enabled on PostgreSQL add-ons.  
The autovacuum will proceed when a given percentage of rows of a table will be updated/inserted/deleted.  
Usually this threshold is set to 20%.

## `pg_activity`

If you want to use [pg_activity](https://github.com/dalibo/pg_activity) on an PostgreSQL addon but you get an `Exception: Must be run with database superuser privileges.` you need to add the flag `--rds` when you start it.
