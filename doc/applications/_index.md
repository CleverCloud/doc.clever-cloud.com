## How To Deploy X if It Isn't Natively Supported

If your favorite runtime is not available, you can deploy it on Clever Cloud by Dockerizing it and make it run in a Docker instance.
You will probably find a basic Docker file for your technology on the Docker hub.

Refer to the [Docker](/doc/applications/docker) section of this documentation to know how to deploy your Dockerized application.

If you are out of options, contact our support team and we'll come up with a solution with you.

## Environment Variables

You can control deployments and set your application configuration with environment variables:

### Common to All Applications

- Applications on Clever Cloud listen on **port 8080**. Be sure you application is able to listen on port 8080 before deploying.
- Deployments on Clever Cloud are immutable: if your app restarts, last pushed commit will be deployed with your current environment variables.
