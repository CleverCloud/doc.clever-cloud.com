## Overview

Docker is an easy, lightweight virtualized environment for portable applications.

Docker containers can encapsulate any payload, and will run consistently on and between virtually any server. The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop will run at scale, in production, on VMs, bare-metal servers, public instances, or combinations of the above.

Clever Cloud allows you to deploy any application running inside a Docker container. This page will explain how to set up your application to run it on our service.
