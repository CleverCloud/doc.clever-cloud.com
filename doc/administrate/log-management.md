Log management is currently only available through our API and [clever-tools]({{< ref "/doc/CLI" >}}).

{{< callout type="info">}}
Logs are currently retained for a maximum of 7 days. Logs are flushed daily at midnight.
You can use log drains if a greater retention is needed.
{{< /callout >}}

## Get continuous logs from your application

You can see logs with the command down below.

```bash
clever logs
```

You can also add a flag `--before` or `--after` followed by a date (ISO8601 format).

```bash
clever logs --before 2016-08-11T14:54:33.971Z
```

You can also get your add-on's logs by using `--addon` flag, the value must be the add-on id starting by `addon_`. 

```bash
clever logs --addon <addon_xxx>
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
   Only the last 1000 lines of logs are got by `clever logs`.
{{< /callout >}}

### Access logs

It contains all incoming requests to your application. Here is an example:

```txt
255.255.255.255 - - [06/Feb/2020:07:59:22 +0100] "GET /aget/to/your/beautiful/website -" 200 1453
```

They are available in different formats, the most common is CLF which stands for Common Log Format.

You can see access logs with the following command:

```bash
clever accesslogs
```

As with the `logs` command, you can specify `--before` and `--after` flags as well as the `--follow`  to display access logs continuously.

If you need to change the ouput you can specify the `--format` flag with one of these values:

- simple: `2021-06-25T10:11:35.358Z 255.255.255.255 GET /`
- extended: `2021-06-25T10:11:35.358Z [ 255.255.255.255 - Nantes, FR ] GET www.clever-cloud.com / 200`
- clf: `255.255.255.255 - - [25/Jun/2021:12:11:35 +0200] "GET / -" 200 562`
- json:
  
  ```json
    {
        "t":"2021-06-25T10:11:35.358209Z",
        "a":"app_xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "adc":"clevercloud-adc-nX",
        "o":"orga_xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",

            "ct":"Nantes",
            "co":"FR"
        },

        },
        "vb":"GET",

        "bIn":658,"bOut":562,

        "scheme":"HTTPS",

        "r":"01F91AEG8Z9RJKYB7JY7H56FNB",
        "tlsV":"TLS1.3"
    }
  ```

## Exporting logs to an external tool

You can use the logs drains to send your application's logs to an external server with the following command.

```bash
clever drain create [--alias <alias>] <DRAIN-TYPE> <DRAIN-URL> [--username <username>] [--password <password>]
```

Where `DRAIN-TYPE` is one of:

- `TCPSyslog`: for TCP syslog endpoint;
- `UDPSyslog`: for UDP syslog endpoint;
- `HTTP`: for TCP syslog endpoint (note that this endpoint has optional username/password parameters as HTTP Basic Authentication);
- `ElasticSearch`: for Elasticsearch endpoint (note that this endpoint requires username/password parameters as HTTP Basic Authentication);
- `DatadogHTTP`: for Datadog endpoint (note that this endpoint needs your Datadog API Key).

You can list the currently activated drains with this command.

```bash
clever drain [--alias <alias>]
```

And remove them if needed

```bash
clever drain remove [--alias <alias>] <DRAIN-ID>
```

If the status of your drain is shown as `DISABLED` without you disabling it, it may be because we  have not been able to send your logs to your drain endpoint or because the requests timed out after **25 seconds**.

You can also use the logs drain to send your add-on's logs by using `--addon` flag, the value must be the add-on id starting by `addon_`. 

### Elasticsearch

ElasticSearch drains use the Elastic bulk API. To match this endpoint, specify `/_bulk` at the end of your Elasticsearch endpoint.

```bash
clever drain create ElasticSearch https://xxx-elasticsearch.services.clever-cloud.com/_bulk --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD
```

Each day, we will create an index `logstash-<yyyy-MM-dd>` and push logs to it.

#### Index Lifecycle Management

Depending on the amount of logs generated by your application, you might want to manage the lifecyle of your log indexes to prevent your Elasticsearch instance from running out of storage space.

To do so, Elasticsearch provides a functionnality called [Index Lifecycle management](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html) that allows you to create a policy to delete indexes based on their creation date.

With our Elasticsearch add-on, you can choose to create a Kibana application in which you can create the policy and apply it to your indexes with an index template, but you can create them manually through API requests.

Here is an example that will create a policy to delete indexes older than 30 days:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://username:password@xxx-elasticsearch.services.clever-cloud.com/_ilm/policy/logs_drain?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "30d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {} 
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

An index template example to apply the policy based on an index pattern:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://username:password@xxx-elasticsearch.services.clever-cloud.com/_index_template/logs_drain?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "index_patterns": ["logstash-*"], 
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "index.lifecycle.name": "logs_drain"
    }
  }
}
'
```

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/set-up-lifecycle-policy.html).

### Datadog

To create a [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/fr/api/latest/logs/#send-logs) drain, you just need to use:

```bash
clever drain create DatadogHTTP "https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com/v1/input/<API_KEY>?ddsource=clevercloud&service=<SERVICE>&hostname=<HOST>"
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Datadog has two zones, **EU** and **COM**. An account on one zone is not available on the other, make sure to target the right intake endpoint (`datadoghq.eu` or `datadoghq.com`).
{{< /callout >}}

### NewRelic

To create a [NewRelic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/) drain, you just need to use:

```bash
clever drain create NewRelicHTTP "https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1" --api-key "<API_KEY>"
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
NewRelic has two zones, **EU** and **US**. An account on one zone is not available on the other, make sure to target the right intake endpoint (`log-api.eu.newrelic.com` or `log-api.newrelic.com`).
{{< /callout >}}
