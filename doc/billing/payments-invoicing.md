## Make a payment

In the sidebar of the organization section, there are three alternatives to buy credit for your applications:

* Credit card (powered by Stripe)
* Paypal
* Bank transfer: we accept international bank transfers. This option will generate a reference that you will have to add to your bank transfert, as a note.
* SEPA Direct Debit: we support payment via SEPA debit. More information in the [SEPA Direct Debit section](#sepa-direct-debit)


## Invoices

Invoices are available in the *Invoices* tab in the sidebar of the organization section. Once paid, invoices are moved to the "Paid invoice" table.

### About invoices issuance and notifications

As explained in the [Monthly Invoice documentation]({{< ref "doc/billing/unified-invoices.md#monthly-invoice" >}}),
we issue an invoice at the beginning of every month. We attach the invoice to an email we send you. In accordance with SEPA rules and the mandate your agreed to, this email will notify you that a debit we send you. 
Following SEPA rules and the mandate you agreed to, this email notifies you will be attempted the 5th of the month, so three to four days after the notification. that Clever Cloud is going to charge you on the 5th of the month, three to four days after
the notification.
