## Status of your application

Clever-tools can show you the status of an application on Clever Cloud using `clever status`. This command shows you if the application is running or stopped and informations about the scalability of your application.

## Activity of your application

`clever-tools` can show you the activity of an application. For each deployment, you get :

* date and time of deployment
* status (OK or FAIL)
* action (DEPLOY or UNDEPLOY)
* commit ID
* tool used to deploy (Git/Console/clever-tools/...)

In order to show those informations, use :

```shell
# Show the last 10 deployments
clever activity

# Show all deployments
clever activity --show-all

# Show deployments and track new ones
clever activity --follow
```

## Listing linked applications

You can list your linked applications with `clever applications`. For each application, the command shows you the alias, the id and the deployment url.

```shell
# List linked applications
clever applications

# List only application aliases
clever applications --only-aliases
```
