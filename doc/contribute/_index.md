## Before writing something new

Before you start writing something new please create a [Github issue](https://github.com/CleverCloud/documentation/issues) so we can talk about it. Moslty to make sure someone is not already working on the same thing.

## Writing new content

There are a number of things you need to be aware of when writing new content. We use Markdown files and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate this documentation.

### Debug Mode

If you add `debug=true` as params of your Hugo site, you should see every shortcode outlined on your website like so:

<div class="shortcode-debug"><strong>myshortcode </strong><p>This is a shortcode being used</div>
