In addition to the Clever Cloud console, you can manage your addons and applications from the command line with Clever Tools.

## Installing Clever Tools

The clever-tools CLI can be installed through many different channels depending on your system setup.

### Via npm

If you already have node/npm on your system, you can run:

```sh
npm install -g clever-tools
```

If you want to install our latest beta release, you can run:

```sh
npm install -g clever-tools@beta
```

### On GNU/Linux

#### Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)

{{< alert "warning" "Bintray to Nexus" >}}
<p>We recently moved from Bintray to a self-hosted Nexus repository available at <a href="https://nexus.clever-cloud.com">https://nexus.clever-cloud.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you were using Bintray to install our <code>.deb</code> packages, you will need to edit your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> and remove the old entry with <code>https://dl.bintray.com/clevercloud/deb</code> before going further.</p>
{{< /alert >}}

If you are using a GNU/Linux distribution that uses `.deb` packages like Debian or Ubuntu, you can run:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://clever-tools.clever-cloud.com/gpg/cc-nexus-deb.public.gpg.key | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cc-nexus-deb.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cc-nexus-deb.gpg] https://nexus.clever-cloud.com/repository/deb stable main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-get update
apt-get install clever-tools
```

NOTES:

* The `.deb` packages are hosted on Clever Cloud's public Nexus instance available at [https://nexus.clever-cloud.com](https://nexus.clever-cloud.com).
* Our PGP key is required to trust the repository.
* If you want access to the beta channel, you can use this in your `sources.list`:

```sh
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cc-nexus-deb.gpg] https://nexus.clever-cloud.com/repository/deb-beta beta main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
```

#### CentOS/Fedora (.rpm)

{{< alert "warning" "Bintray to Nexus" >}}
<p>We recently moved from Bintray to a self-hosted Nexus repository available at <a href="https://nexus.clever-cloud.com">https://nexus.clever-cloud.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you were using Bintray to install our <code>.rpm</code> packages, you will need to remove the old <code>/etc/yum.repos.d/bintray-clevercloud-rpm.repo</code> before going further.</p>
{{< /alert >}}

If you are using a GNU/Linux distribution that uses `.rpm` packages like CentOS or Fedora, you can run:

```sh
curl -s https://clever-tools.clever-cloud.com/repos/cc-nexus-rpm.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/cc-nexus-rpm.repo
yum update
yum install clever-tools
```

NOTES:

* The `.rpm` packages are hosted on Clever Cloud's public Nexus instance available at [https://nexus.clever-cloud.com](https://nexus.clever-cloud.com).
* If you want access to the beta channel, you will need to edit `/etc/yum.repos.d/cc-nexus-rpm.repo` and set `enabled=1` for the `[clever-tools-beta]`.

#### Arch Linux

If you are using Arch Linux, the packages can be installed from AUR with this repo: [clever-tools-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/clever-tools-bin/).
If you don't know how to use this, you can run:

```sh
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/clever-tools-bin.git clever-tools
cd clever-tools
makepkg -si
```

NOTES:

* If you want access to the beta channel, you can use this repo [clever-tools-bin-beta](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/clever-tools-bin-beta/).

#### Exherbo

If you are using Exherbo, you can run:

```sh
cave resolve repository/CleverCloud -zx1
cave resolve clever-tools-bin -zx
```

#### Other distributions (.tar.gz)

If you are using another GNU/Linux distribution, you can download a `.tar.gz` archive and extract the binary in your `PATH`:

```sh
curl -O https://clever-tools.clever-cloud.com/releases/latest/clever-tools-latest_linux.tar.gz
tar xvzf clever-tools-latest_linux.tar.gz
cp clever-tools-latest_linux/clever ~/.local/bin/
```

NOTES:

* The packages are available on Clever Cloud's Cellar bucket: [clever-tools-latest_linux.tar.gz](https://clever-tools.clever-cloud.com/releases/latest/clever-tools-latest_linux.tar.gz).
* You can also retrieve any release (including beta) on this Cellar bucket by replacing `latest` (path and filename) with the version number you need.

### On macOS

#### Using homebrew

If you are using macOS and you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed, you can run:

```sh
brew install CleverCloud/homebrew-tap/clever-tools
```

NOTES:

* If you want access to the beta channel, you can use `CleverCloud/homebrew-tap-beta/clever-tools` instead.

#### Using the `.tar.gz` archive

If you are using macOS, but you don't have [homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed, you can download a `.tar.gz` archive and extract the binary in your `PATH`:

```sh
curl -O https://clever-tools.clever-cloud.com/releases/latest/clever-tools-latest_macos.tar.gz
tar xvzf clever-tools-latest_macos.tar.gz
cp clever-tools-latest_macos/clever ~/.local/bin/
```

NOTES:

* The packages are available on Clever Cloud's Cellar bucket: [clever-tools-latest_macos.tar.gz](https://clever-tools.clever-cloud.com/releases/latest/clever-tools-latest_macos.tar.gz).
* You can also retrieve any release (including beta) on this Cellar bucket by replacing `latest` (path and filename) with the version number you need.

### On Windows

#### Using chocolatey

{{< alert "warning" "Bintray to Nexus" >}}
<p>We recently moved from Bintray to a self-hosted Nexus repository available at <a href="https://nexus.clever-cloud.com">https://nexus.clever-cloud.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you were using Bintray to install our <code>.nupkg</code> packages, you will need to remove the old source.</p>
{{< /alert >}}

If you are using Windows and you have [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) installed, you can run:

```bash
choco sources add -n=clevercloud -s='https://nexus.clever-cloud.com/repository/nupkg/'
choco install clever-tools
```

NOTES:

* If you want access to the beta channel, you can use `choco sources add -n=clevercloud -s='https://nexus.clever-cloud.com/repository/nupkg-beta/'` instead.

#### Using the `.zip` archive

If you are using Windows, but you don't have [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) installed, you can download a `.zip` archive and extract the binary in your `PATH`.

NOTES:

* The packages are available on Clever Cloud's Cellar bucket: [clever-tools-latest_win.tar.gz](https://clever-tools.clever-cloud.com/releases/latest/clever-tools-latest_win.zip).
* You can also retrieve any release (including beta) on this Cellar bucket by replacing `latest` (path and filename) with the version number you need.

### Via Docker

If you are using docker, you can use the image provided [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/clevercloud/clever-tools/).

```sh
docker pull clevercloud/clever-tools
docker run --rm clever-tools <command>
```

#### Dockerfile

In your `Dockerfile` you can copy the clever-tools CLI from the image itself with a simple one liner:

```Dockerfile
COPY --from=clevercloud/clever-tools /bin/clever /usr/local/bin/clever
```

### Via Nix

If you are using Nix, you will find a Nix derivation on Fretlink's GitHub repository: https://github.com/fretlink/clever-tools-nix

## Enabling autocompletion

The clever-tools CLI comes with a comprehensive auto-completion system.
Some installation methods like `.deb` packages, `.rpm` packages or brew will try to enable it automatically.
If it does not work, try this for bash:

```bash
clever --bash-autocomplete-script $(which clever) | sudo tee /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/clever
```

or this for zsh:

```bash
clever --zsh-autocomplete-script $(which clever) | sudo tee /usr/share/zsh/site-functions
```

## Linking your account

To use `clever-tools`, you have to login.

```sh
clever login
```

It will open the Web console in your browser and reuse your existing session if you're already logged in.

`clever login` tries to open a browser through `xdg-open` on GNU/Linux systems (and in bash for windows).
Make sure you have `xdg-utils` available as well as a default browser set (or you can copy and paste the URL displayed in the console.

## Linking an existing application

If you have an already existing application, you can start managing it with
Clever Tools.

```sh
# First, go to your local repository
cd /path/to/your/application

# Then, link it to the Clever Cloud application
clever link <app_id>

# You can also use the application name (make sure to specify the
# organization name if your application is in an organization.
clever link --org <org_name> <app_name>

# Unlink an application
clever unlink <app_id>
```

{{< alert "info" "Notes on `.clever.json`" >}}
  <p>Once you have linked an application, clever-tools will create a Json configuration file named `.clever.json` at the root of the directory.</p>
  <p>This file can be commited safely, others team members working on this repository will not have to link the application again.</p>
  <p>This configuration file contains the AppID, so keep this in mind if you publish it on a public repository.</p>
{{< /alert >}}

## Deploying new code

After having written new code, you can deploy it to Clever Cloud

```sh
# Will git push your code to Clever Cloud and display logs
clever deploy

# Will open your application
clever open
```
