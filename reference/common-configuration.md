Each instance type (php,java,python,go,rubyâ€¦) has its own configuration. However, some of
these configuration items can be applied to any instance.

## Private SSH Key

If your company manages its own artifacts in a private repository (like, you
can only access them via git+ssh or sftp), and you need a private key to
connect to the server, you can either set it in an environment variable or
commit it in your application's Clever Cloud repository.

That key will be installed in `~/.ssh/` before the start of the build. So the
dependency manager will use it to fetch libs only accessible by ssh.

*NB: Please provide a key without pass phrase, or the system will be unable to unlock it*

### Environment variable

Set your key as the value of the `CC_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` variable. If you want it
to be saved to a specific file, you can set the `CC_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`
variable.

### Committed file

First, you need to add the file `clevercloud/ssh.json`, its content is pretty straight-forward:

```javascript
{
    "privateKeyFile": "path/to/file"
}
```

The `privateKeyFile` field must be a path to a SSH private key. The path must be relative to the root of your repository. e.g. if your private key file is in the `clevercloud` folder and is named `my_key`, the `privateKeyFile` field will be `"clevercloud/my_key"`.

## Hooks

You can run specific tasks during the deployment of your application. Please
refer to the [hooks documentation]({{< ref "develop/build-hooks.md" >}}) to learn
more about them.

## Workers

You can run background tasks running in parallel of your application. They will be restarted automatically on error.
Those are especially useful for environments where you can't have long-running processes such as PHP, ruby or python.

The workers run in the same environment as your application. They are launched in the application's directory.

All you need to do is add one (or several) environment variables as such:

```
CC_WORKER_COMMAND=my-awesome-worker
```

Or

```
CC_WORKER_COMMAND_0=my-awesome-worker
CC_WORKER_COMMAND_1=my-other-worker
```

By default, workers will be restarted if they exit with an error code. You can customise this behavior by setting the
environment variable `CC_WORKER_RESTART` to one of `always`, `on-failure` (the default) or `no`.
