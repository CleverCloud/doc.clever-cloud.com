## Contributing Process

You can either make a [pull-request](https://github.com/CleverCloud/doc.clever-cloud.com/pulls) OR submit a content via the **Contribute** button here: https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc

## Coding style

Each page begins with a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) section used for metadata, and the rest of the article is written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Make sure to reduce inline HTML to the maximum, although it is needed for some table formatting.

### YAML section

* **title**: The title used for the search result and the `H1` of the article page.
* **shortdesc**: Used to search terms via Algolia and shows up when you're using the search.
* **tags**: The tags are used to categorize the article in sections (within Account Setup, Dashboard Setup, CLI, Apps, Addons, Developer, Billing, Support and FAQ)
* **keywords**: Used to reference the article in Algolia's index for improved search (optional).

### Article section

The first header in your content should be a `H2`, as the `H1` will be used by the `title` variable in the YAML section.

You can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your fenced code block.
For example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
We use highlightjs to perform language detection and syntax highlighting. You can find out which keywords are valid [here](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/).


### Write and use partials

Partials are located under the `partial` folder at the root of this project. They are written in Markdown.

#### Rendering partial in page

Partials are called using the following shortcode: 
```
{{< readfile "/path/to/partial/from/root/of/project.md" >}}
```

#### Using variables in a partial

You may want to display different chunks of partial content depending on which page you are working on.
This is achieved by creating two things:

1. a placeholder word to replace in the partial content.
This placeholder word must:
- begin and finish with an `@`
- be the most self-explanatory possible
- be used only once in this partial unless specific case (see note below)
- not be used in other partials unless you want to replace it with the exact same value
Example placeholder word: `@addon-name@`

2. creating the key `str_replace_dict` in the front matter section and add to it the matching placeholder word and their replacements.
You must add this in the front matter of *each* page using the partial.
e.g: 
```
str_replace_dict:
  "@addon-name@": "my addon name"
  "@another-variable@": "other variable replacement str"
```

Notes:
- the function used to find and replace uses [regex](https://regex-golang.appspot.com/assets/html/index.html), please make sure not to use reserved characters. If you have to use some, think about it twice and if you still need them, escape them properly.
- the function will only replace the first occurence it founds, if you have to replace two times the same key, have it appear twice in the front matter `str_replace_dict` also.
e.g:
```
partial/mypartial.md

Text @addon-name@ holding two codes @addon-name@.
```

```
folder/file.md

---
...
str_replace_dict:
  "@addon-name@": "PostgreSQL"
  "@addon-name@": "PostgreSQL"
---
```

Output: `Text PostgreSQL holding two codes PostgreSQL.`
