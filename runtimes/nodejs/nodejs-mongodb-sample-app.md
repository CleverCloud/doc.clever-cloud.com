If you want to test our platform and deploy this application, just follow these simple steps:

1. Fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CleverCloud/demo-nodejs-mongodb).
2. Create an application from your github repo.
3. Create a [MongoDB add-on](/doc/addons/clever-cloud-addons/) and link it to your application.
4. That's all the application will use the environment variables to connect to MongoDB.
