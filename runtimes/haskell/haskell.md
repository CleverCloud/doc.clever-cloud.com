Clever Cloud allows you to deploy haskell web applications. This page will explain
you how to set up your application to run it on our service.

## Overview

Haskell is a purely functional language, especially suited for robust web
applications. There are many ways to write web applications in haskell, from
raw [WAI](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai) to full-stack frameworks
like [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/), simple libraries like
[scotty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty) or
type-safe solutions like [servant](https://haskell-servant.github.io/).

Clever Cloud uses stack to build haskell applications.

## Create an application

Refer to the page [Deploy an application on Clever Cloud](/doc/clever-cloud-overview/add-application/).

## Necessary information

Be sure that:

* you have pushed in <b>master branch</b>
* you listen on <b>port 8080</b>
* you have one and only one binary target in your `.cabal` file
* your project has a `stack.yaml` file

## Requirements

The steps ran in order are:

 - `stack setup`
 - `stack install --only-dependencies`
 - `stack install`
 - `./<path>/my-exe` (or the contents of `CC_RUN_COMMAND`)

The executable built by `stack build` (or the command you specify) must start a
web server listening on `0.0.0.0:8080`.

For instance, a minimal scotty application can look like this:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Web.Scotty

main = scotty 8080 $ do
  get "/" $ do
    html $ "Hello world"
```

### Dependencies

Make sure to list all your dependencies in your `.cabal` file. For the example
above, you need:

```
  build-depends:       base
                     , scotty
```

Compiled dependencies are cached by default to speed up deployments. You can
disable dependencies caching completely by removing the `CC_CACHE_DEPENDENCIES`
environment variable. If you want to rebuild your application from scratch,
you can select "rebuild and restart" from the console or launch `clever
restart --without-cache` from CLI.

## Environment injection

Clever Cloud can inject environment variables that are defined in the
dashboard and by add-ons linked to your application.

You can access environment variables with `getEnv :: String -> IO String` in
`System.Environment`.

If environment variables are needed for your application to work properly, the
best solution is to load them in your `main` function and crash with a helpful
error message if they're not properly defined.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
module Main where

import Data.Text.Lazy (pack)
import System.Environment (getEnv)
import Web.Scotty (get, html, scotty)

envVar = getEnv "MY_VAR"

main = do
  myVar <- envVar
  scotty 8080 $ do
    get "/" $ do
      html . pack $ "Hello world " ++ myVar
```

This way, the application will refuse to start if `MY_VAR` is not defined.

For more information, you can read about [environment variables on Clever
Cloud](/doc/admin-console/environment-variables/).

## Custom run command

If you need to run a custom command (or just pass options to the binary built
by stack), you can specify it through the `CC_RUN_COMMAND` environment variable.

For instance, for a hakyll website, you can put

```
CC_RUN_COMMAND=~./local/bin/site server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

## Log interactivity and Output buffering

When printing text to stdout, you may experience a little delay. This happens
because by default, when running outside of an interactive terminal, haskell
programs aggressively buffer output, instead of flushing content line by line.
On small scalers, it can lead to lost logs (the buffer gets too big and the log
collector is killed before having a chance to send logs). To avoid this, you can
force the output buffer to be flushed line by line, as in a terminal session.

```haskell
module Main where

import System.IO

main :: IO ()
main = do
  hSetBuffering stdout LineBuffering
  -- your program goes here
```

Of course, only do that for programs where you want low latency for
text output, as it can significantly affect performance.

## Deploy on Clever Cloud

Application deployment on Clever Cloud is via Git. Follow [these
steps](/doc/clever-cloud-overview/add-application/) to deploy your
application.
