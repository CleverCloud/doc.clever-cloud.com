## Configure your Node.js + MongoDB application
### My application does not exists already

If you want to test easily a Node.js deployment on Clever Cloud, just clone the [GitHub repo](https://GitHub.com/CleverCloud/demo-nodejs-mongodb-rest) and jump to [My application already exists](#my-application-already-exists)

## Configure your database

Make sure you have created a MongoDB add-on in the Clever Cloud console, and that it's linked to your application. When it's done, you will be able to access all of your add-on [environment variables](#setting-up-environment-variables-on-clever-cloud) from the application.
