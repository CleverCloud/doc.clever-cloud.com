## Overview

Haskell is a purely functional language, especially suited for robust web applications.

There are many ways to write web applications in haskell, from raw [WAI](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai) to full-stack frameworks like [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com/), simple libraries like [scotty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty) or type-safe solutions like [servant](https://haskell-servant.GitHub.io/).
