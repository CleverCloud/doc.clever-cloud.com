# Git Deployment
*You will need git on your computer to deploy via this tool. Here is the official website of Git to get more informations&nbsp;: <a href="http://git-scm.com">git-scm.com</a>*

<div class="alert alert-hot-problems">
   <h4>Caution:</h4>
   <p>Currently there is no data persistence when using Git deploy, autogenerated content (eg. with Drupal, Wordpress or Joomla) will be destroyed on each redeploy. We recommend to use FTP deploy at this time.</p>

After you created an app in the [console](https://console.clever-cloud.com), the console prompt you the following message&nbsp;:

1. Click on "close". The "General information" page gives you your git deployment URL which is of the form ``git+ssh://git@push.clever-cloud.com/<your_app_id>.git``. Copy it in your clipboard.
2. On your computer, go into your application repository. 
If you didn't already track your app with git, start by typing:  

    	$ git init

3. Then, use the "git remote" command to add the deploy URL:

		$ git remote add <name> <your-git-deployment-url>

4. The last step is to push your application:

		$ git push <name> master
