# Git Deployment
*You will need git on your computer to deploy via this tool. Here is the official website of Git to get more informations&nbsp;: <a href="http://git-scm.com">git-scm.com</a>*

After you created an app in the [console](https://console.clever-cloud.com), the console prompt you the following message&nbsp;:

1. Click on "close". The "General information" page gives you your git deployment URL which is of the form ``git+ssh://git@push.clever-cloud.com/<your_app_id>.git``. Copy it in your clipboard.
2. On your computer, go into your application repository. 
If you didn't already track your app with git, start by typing:  

    	$ git init

3. Then, use the "git remote" command to add the deploy URL:

		$ git remote add <name> <your-git-deployment-url>

4. The last step is to push your application:

		$ git push <name> master

If you send a Java app, and want to use Maven, Ant or SBT, don't forget to include the cc_conf.json. For more details, check the [deployment configuration page](/cc-conf/)
