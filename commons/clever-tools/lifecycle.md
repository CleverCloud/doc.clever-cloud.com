## Get continuous logs from your application

You can see logs with the command down below.

    clever logs

You can also add a flag `--before` or `--after` followed by a date (ISO8601 format).

    # Here is an example
    clever logs --before 2016-08-11T14:54:33.971Z

### Logs drains: exporting logs to an external tools

You can use the logs drains to send your application's logs to an external server with the following command.


    clever drain create [--alias <alias>] <DRAIN-TYPE> <DRAIN-URL> [--username <username>] [--password <password>]

Where `DRAIN-TYPE` is one of:

 - `TCPSyslog`: for TCP syslog endpoint
 - `UDPSyslog`: for UDP syslog endpoint
 - `HTTP`: for TCP syslog endpoint (note that this endpoint has optional username/password parameters as HTTP Basic Authentication)
 - `ElasticSearch`: for ElasticSearch endpoint (note that this endpoint requires username/password parameters as HTTP Basic Authentication)

ElasticSearch drains use the Elastic bulk API. To match this endpoint, specify `/_bulk` at the end of your ElasticSearch endpoint.
 
You can list the currently activated drains with this command.

    clever drain [--alias <alias>]

And remove them if needed

    clever drain remove [--alias <alias>] <DRAIN-ID>

## Listing linked applications

You can list your linked applications with `clever applications`. For each application, the command shows you the alias, the id and the deployment url.

    # List linked applications
    clever applications

    # List only application aliases
    clever applications --only-aliases

## Status of your application

Clever-tools can show you the status of an application on Clever Cloud using `clever status`. This command shows you if the application is running or stopped and informations about the scalability of your application.

## Activity of your application

`clever-tools` can show you the activity of an application. For each deployment, you get :

* date and time of deployment
* status (OK or FAIL)
* action (DEPLOY or UNDEPLOY)
* commit ID
* tool used to deploy (Git/Console/clever-tools/...)

In order to show those informations, use :

    # Show the last 10 deployments
    clever activity

    # Show all deployments
    clever activity --show-all

    # Show deployments and track new ones
    clever activity --follow
