The Clever Cloud console and clever-tools are built on top of an API that
allows you to manage your account and products. This article will explain how
to connect to this API and use it.

## HTTP calls

### **Authentication**

Clever Cloud API has an OAuth1 based authentication.

There are 2 supported methods for the signature: PLAINTEXT and HMAC-SHA1.
While PLAINTEXT is way easier for testing, you **should** use HMAC-SHA1
when it comes to production. This ensures that the request is totally verified.

We have a [JavaScript client on GitHub](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-client.js)
where you can find a lot of informations.
Especially in the [src/session.js file](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-client.js/blob/master/src/session.js)

This client is being used by the Console. Also, the Console gives you a lot
of informations in the "network" panel of the devtools. If you're stuck, this
is one way for debugging.

For the Authorization header, make sure to have something like:
```bash
 Authorization: OAuth key="value", key2="value2"
```
The ``OAuth`` and doubles quotes around values are mandatory
#### **Create consumers tokens**

You need to create an oauth consumer token in the Clever Cloud console.
A link "Create an oauth consumer" is available under your organization's
addons list. All created consumers will appear below that link, like your
applications and addons.

These consumers allow you to register an application. By creating a consumer,
users will be able to grant (or decline) privileges for your application.
For example, the Clever Cloud Console is using an oauth consumer.
You (most of the time) give it full access to manage your account.

You need to set a callback URL, this is the url your user will be redirected to
after he has been authenticated.

#### **Get a request token**

You have to make a `POST`request to get a
[request token](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/api/#!/oauth/oauth_request_token_post)
to the API.

#### **Get the authorization URL**

Ask the API for the [authorization URL](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/api/#!/oauth/oauth_authorize_get)
and go to this URL with a browser. Log in with your account and it will send you
to the callback URL.

#### **Get the verifier token**

In the callback URL, you have the verifier token:

`http://www.example.com/callback?oauth_verifier=<verifierToken>`

Where `<verifierToken>` is your token.

#### **Get the access token**
Make a `POST`  request to get the
[access token](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/api/#!/oauth/oauth_access_token_post)
 with your request token and the verifier.
You can use this access token to make OAuth1 signed requests.

### **API endpoints documentation**

All the API endpoints are referenced in a swagger documentation.

 * [https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/api/](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/api/)

The base URL for the API is :

 * `https://api.clever-cloud.com/v2/`

## WebSocket API requests

### **Connection protocol**

Clever Cloud API can handle WebSocket-Security requests for the logs or events.
To connect to a WebSocket API URL follow this guide.

 * Take a URL in the API for the WebSocket.
 * Ex: `https://api.clever-cloud.com/v2/events/event-socket`
 * Sign the OAuth request with this URL.
 * Replace `https://` by `wss://`
 * `wss://api.clever-cloud.com/v2/events/event-socket`
 * Connect to this URL in WebSocket
 * When the WebSocket connection is opened, you need to send the OAuth1 header in
this format :
```json
{
	"message_type": "oauth",
	"authorization": "<oauth_header>"
}
```
You need to replace `<oauth_header>` by the signed OAuth1 header.

### **Available WebSocket endpoints**

#### **Logs-Socket**

[This endpoint](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/api/#!/logs/logs_logs-socket_appId_get)
allow you to receive real-time logs of an application via WebSocket.

#### **Events**
[This endpoint](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/api/#!/events/events_event-socket_get)
allow you to receive a stream of events emitted on your account.
Events like git push, add or remove an application / addon, deployments success / failed
are available.
