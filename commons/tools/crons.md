The configuration file used for crontab is `/clevercloud/cron.json`.

Here is the general syntax:

```haskell
  [
    "<string>",
    "<string>"
  ]
```

The string `<string>` must use the cron format:

```javascript
M H d m Y command
```

 - M: Minute [0,59]
 - H: Hour [0,23]
 - d: Day of the month [1,31]
 - m: Month of the year [1,12]
 - Y: Day of the week [0,6] (0 is Sunday)

There are two restrictions about the usage of crontab on our platform:

* The special date `@reboot` is not available since the crontab is added after the startup of the instance
* You must use the absolute path of commands

You can use the special variable `$ROOT` to refer to the root folder of your application.

Example of `clevercloud/cron.json` which executes the file `cron.php` every 5 minutes:

```haskell
  [
    "*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/php $ROOT/cron.php"
  ]
```

## Access environment variables

Environment variables are not available in scripts / executables ran from crons. You must inject them yourself.

To do so, your cron should call a shell script which will inject the environment and in turn run your command:

In `clevercloud/cron.json`:

```haskell
  [
    "*/5 * * * * sh $ROOT/path/to/script.sh"
  ]
```
And in `script.sh`:

```bash 
#! /usr/bin/env bash

source /home/bas/applicationrc

/usr/bin/php $APP_HOME/cron.php
```
Now you can call environment variables as you want in `cron.php`.   

If you need to inject environnement variables in more than one cron you pass the cron in arguments on the bash script:  
In `clevercloud/cron.json`:

```haskell
  [
    "*/5 * * * * sh $ROOT/path/to/script.sh cron.php",
    "*/10 * * * * sh $ROOT/path/to/script.sh other_cron.php"
  ]
```
And in `script.sh`:

```bash 
#! /usr/bin/env bash

source /home/bas/applicationrc

/usr/bin/php $APP_HOME/$1
```
You can refer to [this list](/doc/admin-console/environment-variables#special-environment-variables) to see which variables are available.

<div class="alert alert-hot-problems">
<h4>Warning:</h4>
  <p>All the servers are configured to use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), please keep it in mind when configuring cron tasks to run at a specific hour.</p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-hot-problems">
<h4>Warning:</h4>
  <p>We do not currently support the clustering of cron tasks, you must manage it yourself if your application requires more than one instance.</p>
</div>
