## Start, restart and stop

You can start, restart, and stop your application in the associated configuration panel.

Stop functionality is useful during the development of the application to limit its credit consumption.

## Logs

The Clever Cloud dashboard gives you the ability to retrieve your application logs.

To get them, just click on *Logs* in the left navbar.

## Dedicated build

Your application can be built on a different instance (with more ressources) and then be deployed on its regular scaler.
`pico` and `nano` scalers are using this feature by default.
You can find the option under your application informations: `Enable dedicated build instance`.
