## Logs

The Clever Cloud dashboard gives you the ability to retrieve your application logs.

To get them, just click on *Logs* in the left navbar.

## Dedicated build

Your application can be built on a different instance (with more ressources) and then be deployed on its regular scaler.
`pico` and `nano` scalers are using this feature by default.
You can find the option under your application informations: `Enable dedicated build instance`.
