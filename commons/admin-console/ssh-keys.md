SSH keys are used to establish a secure connection between your computer and Clever Cloud.  
You need to add a SSH key to your Clever Cloud's account to deploy via Git.  
A user can have multiple SSH keys.

<div class="alert alert-hot-problems">
<h4>Warning:</h4>
<p>A SSH key can be used with only one account. A SSH key is used to identify the actions made by a user and must be
associated with only one account.<br />
If a key is used by more than one account, a warning will be displayed in the console.</p>

How to add your SSH key on Clever Cloud?

### GitHub account and SSH key on Clever Cloud

If your account is linked to GitHub, a panel with your GitHub SSH keys will appear in the "SSH Keys" tab.
You can add any key already present in your GitHub account by clicking on the import button next to it.

## Find your SSH key

You may already have an SSH key and so do not need to generate a new one. To check if you have one, follow the steps:

### Linux and Mac

1. Wether you use Mac or Linux, open your Terminal application.
2. Run `cd ~/.ssh/` in your Terminal.
3. If the folder exists, run `ls` and check if a pair of key exists : *id_ed25519* and *id_ed25519.pub*.
   Using *id_rsa* and *id_rsa.pub* is fine too. We are just advocating the use of *ed25519*.
   Smaller to copy and way stronger than 2048-bit RSA keys.
   If you can find them, you do not need to generate a new one, simply go to the following
   "Add your key on Clever Cloud" part!

### Windows

1. If you don't have it, download [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) and install it.
2. Run **Git Bash** (from the *Start Menu* or from the *Explorer* with the contextual menu (right click)).
3. Run `cd ~/.ssh/` in your Terminal.
4. If the folder exists, run `ls` and check if a pair of key exists : *id_ed25519* and *id_ed25519.pub*.
   Using *id_rsa* and *id_rsa.pub* is fine too. We just advocate using *ed25519*.
   Smaller to copy and way stronger than 2048-bit RSA keys.
   If you can find them, you do not need to generate a new one, simply go to the following
   "Add you key on Clever Cloud" part!

## Create your SSH key

If you read the previous section, you should have a Terminal open.

1.  In your Terminal, enter the following bash line:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@youremail.com"
    ```
    This command creates a new ssh key using the provided email, so that the owner of the key can be identified.

2.  When asked, enter a passphrase:

    ```bash
    Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/your_home_path/.ssh/id_ed25519):
    # Now you should enter a passphrase.
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
    Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
    ```

    Which should give you something like this:

    ```bash
    Your identification has been saved in /your_home_path/.ssh/id_ed25519.
    Your public key has been saved in /your_home_path/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    01:0e:e5:2d:ab:98:d6:17:a1:6d:f0:68:9f:d0:a2:db your_email@youremail.com
    ```

## Add your SSH key on Clever Cloud

### Public SSH Key
To declare your **public SSH Key** on Clever Cloud, in the left navigation bar, go in "Profile" and in the "SSH Keys" tab.

Add the key by entering a name and the public SSH key. The key is the entire contents of the **id_ed25519.pub** file.

<div class="alert alert-hot-problems">
<h4>Remember</h4>
<p>Your public SSH key must be associated with only one account.</p>
</div>

If you see "*access denied*" or "*password:*" when you
[push on Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/clever-cloud-overview/add-application/#git-deployment),
your SSH Keys may be invalid or not available on Clever Cloud. Please check that you SSH Key is present and valid in
your profile.
If you want to use a specific key for Clever Cloud, you can set it in your SSH config by adding this :
```
Host *.clever-cloud.com 
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/clevercloud
```

### Private SSH Key
If you want to clone a repository from a private repository, you can add a [Private SSH Key](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/clever-cloud-overview/common-application-configuration/#private-ssh-key).

## Check your ssh configuration

To check if your ssh key is correctly configured, you can try to run:

```bash
    ssh git@push.clever-cloud.com
```

The first time, you may have to type "yes" to continue.

If you see "Permission denied (publickey).", please read below.

## Configure your SSH agent

> git@push-par-clevercloud-customers.services.clever-cloud.com: Permission denied (publickey).
>
> fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
>
> Please make sure you have the correct access rights
> and the repository exists.

An error can occur when your SSH agent has not be configured to use your SSH key.

Most of the time, it's due to the presence of multiple SSH keys generated by 3rd party software, like GitHub for Mac.

You can add those lines into your `~/.ssh/config` file. It tells your SSH agent which key to pick for a given hostname.
Please update your Clever Cloud SSH key path accordingly.

```bash
# config for Clever Cloud specific key (Paris zone)
Host ccloud-par
  Hostname push-par-clevercloud-customers.services.clever-cloud.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_clevercloud

# config for Clever Cloud specific key (Montreal zone)
Host ccloud-mtl
  Hostname push-mtl-clevercloud-customers.services.clever-cloud.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_clevercloud
```
