#  Configuration items available on every instance type.

Each instance type (php,java,python,go,rubyâ€¦) has its own configuration. However, some of
these configuration items can be applied to any instance.

## Private SSH key

If your company manages its own artifacts in a private repository (like, you can only
access them via git+ssh or sftp), and you need a private key to connect to the server, you
can commit them in your application's Clever Cloud repository and then add the
`clevercloud/ssh.json`.

The content of this file is pretty straight-forward:

```javascript
{
    "privateKeyFile": "path/to/file"
}
```

The `privateKeyFile` field must be a path to a SSH private key. The path must be relative
to the root of your repository. e.g. if your private key file is in the `clevercloud`
folder and is named `my_key`, the `privateKeyFile` field will be `"clevercloud/my_key"`.

That key will be installed as `~/.ssh/id_rsa` before the start of the build. So the
dependency manager will use it to fetch libs only accessible by ssh.

*NB: Please provide a key without pass phrase, or the system will be unable to unlock it*

## Post deploy hook

If you need to perform additional actions after your app is started, you can define a
"postDeploy" hook in your `<instance_type>.json` file (e.g. if you are deploying a ruby app,
put it in your `ruby.json` file):

```javascript
{
  "hooks": {
    "postDeploy": "./clevercloud/myScript"
  }
}
```

The `postDeploy` field must contain the path to a script, relative to the root of your
repository. The script file **MUST** have execution right set.

In the example above, the script is a file named `myScript` in the `clevercloud` folder.
That is, right beside the `<instance_type>.json` file.
