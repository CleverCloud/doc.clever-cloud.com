# Application scalling

When your application is running, you don't have the same number of user all the time. During an event for example,
the number of users can grow up and the loading on the server increase. If too many requests are done on your
server in the same time, the response time will increase and could slow down your website.

To avoid this problem and keep a fast website, the main solution is to deploy more **Scalers** of your application to
support the loading. That's what is scalling : adapting automatically the number of **Scalers** and there size to feet the
loading of your application, without action from you.

Clever Cloud gives you the ability to fine tune your application's scaling by managing both horizontal and vertical
scaling. These two parameters can be combined to adapt to your needs.

## What is a Scaler?

A **Scaler** is the Clever Cloud "instance". It is an individual container hosting your application. They are not virtual
machines and are independent. A Scaler is defined by two factors: RAM and CPU.

With the Scalers, Clever Cloud gives you the ability to scale your application **up and down** with **two non
exclusive methods**: horizontal and vertical scaling.

### Enable scalability

To enable the scalability of your application, open the [console](https://console.clever-cloud.com/) and go in the
"scalability" section of your application. Then, enable the auto-scalability.

## Horizontal scaling

In case of large traffic, we detect a high load on your application and spawn **another instance in parallel**.
It gives more power to your application by setting up another identical application. Both will run in parallel with load
balancing. And so on.

This process is exactly the opposite when the **load decreases**. A Scaler is removed and so on till a **minimum
reasonable level** is reached.

The following scheme depicts a Scaler replication in case of a load increase:

</figure>

You can manage the range of Scalers you consider in the application configurator. The range is from 1 to 20.

  <figcaption>Horizontal scaling: the amount of scaler will increase, not the scaler size.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Vertical scaling

In case of large traffic, we detect a high load on your application and set up **a new larger Scaler**.

In case of low traffic, we detect a low load and set up **a new smaller Scaler**.

You give more power to your application by setting up a larger instance that will replace the previous one. The more the
load, the larger the instance.

The following scheme depicts a larger Scaler replacement in case of a load increase:

<figure class="cc-content-img">
  <a href="/assets/images/scaling_vertical_scheme.jpg"><img src="/doc/assets/images/scaling_vertical_scheme.jpg"/></a>
</figure>

You can choose the type of Scalers you consider of just let Clever Cloud choose for you:

<figure class="cc-content-img">
  <a href="/doc/assets/images/select-scalab.png"><img src="/doc/assets/images/select-scalab.png"/></a>
  <figcaption>Vertical scaling: the amount of scalers will not increase in this configuration, but the scaler size will,
  from S to XL.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Combination of both scalings

When both scalings are set up, **vertical scaling** is privileged over **horizontal scaling**. In the case you set the
vertical scaling from S to L, and the horizontal scaling from 2 scalers to 4 scalers, Clever Cloud will firstly up
the size of the 2 scalers already launched.

If the 2 initials scalers are in their maximum size, Clever Cloud will launch new scalers with the maximum size of scalers.
This is how it'll be done :

2-S => 2-M => 2-L => 3-L => 4-L.
